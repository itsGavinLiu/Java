# Core Java Summary
## 1. Syntax
## 1.1 Keywords

| Keyword | Usage |
|--|--------------|
| `private` | <ul><li>`private` keyword is an **access modifier** that can be applied to class members such as fields, methods, and inner classes.</li> <li> When a member is marked as private, it means that it can ***only be accessed from within the same class where it is declared***. Other classes cannot access or modify private members directly.</li></ul> |
| `public` | <ul><li> `public` keyword is an **access modifier** that can be applied to class members such as fields, methods, and inner classes.</li><li>When a member is marked as `public`, it means that it can be ***accessed and used by any other code in the same project***, regardless of whether the code is located in the same package or a different package.</li></ul> |
| `protected` | <ul><li> `protected` keyword is an **access modifier** that can be applied to class members such as fields, methods, and inner classes.</li><li> When a member is marked as `protected`, it means that it can be ***accessed by any other code in the same package, as well as by subclasses of the class where the member is declared***, regardless of whether the subclass is located in the same package or a different package. </li></ul> |
| `abstract` | <ul><li> `abstract` keyword is used to create abstract classes and abstract methods.</li> <li>An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but can be subclassed. It is used as a template for creating concrete subclasses that implement its abstract methods and override its non-abstract methods. Abstract classes can contain abstract and non-abstract methods, as well as fields, constructors, and inner classes.</li> <li>An abstract method is a method that has no implementation in the abstract class and is marked with the abstract keyword. Abstract methods are used to define a method signature (name, return type, parameters) that concrete subclasses must implement. Concrete subclasses must provide an implementation for all abstract methods inherited from their abstract superclass.</li></ul> |
| `extends` | <ul><li> `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits properties (fields and methods) from a superclass. This is used in the declaration of the subclass, followed by the name of the superclass that the subclass is inheriting from.</li><li>The subclass can access and use the `public` and `protected` members (fields and methods) of the superclass, as well as override or add new members. </li></ul>|
| `implements` | <ul><li> `implements` keyword is used to declare that a class implements one or more interfaces. </li> <li>Using implements can be useful for defining a contract for behavior that can be implemented by different classes. Interfaces provide a way to decouple the definition of behavior from its implementation, which can make code more flexible and reusable.</li> </ul> |
| `final` | <ul><li> `final` keyword is used to declare a variable, method, or class that cannot be changed or overridden. </li> <li>A final variable is a constant whose value cannot be changed once it has been initialized. A final variable must be initialized when it is declared, and can only be assigned a value once. </li> <li> A final method is a method that cannot be overridden by a subclass. This is useful when you want to prevent a subclass from changing the behavior of a method that is critical to the functioning of the superclass.</li>  <li>A final class is a class that cannot be subclassed. This is useful when you want to prevent other classes from inheriting from your class and changing its behavior.</li> </ul> |
| `try catch finally` | <ul><li>`try-catch-finally` block is used to handle exceptions, which are unexpected events that can occur during the execution of a program. </li> <li>The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, the code within the try block is immediately exited.</li> <li>The `catch` block catches the thrown exception and handles it appropriately. It contains the code that is executed when an exception of the specified type is thrown.</li> <li>The `finally` block contains the code that is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. It is typically used to release resources, such as files or database connections, that were acquired within the `try` block.</li> </ul>|
| `static` | <ul><li>The `static` keyword is used to create class-level variables and methods that are shared by all instances of a class. When a member of a class is declared as static, it belongs to the class and not to any specific instance of the class. This means that you can access a static member without creating an object of the class.</li> <ul> |
| `throw` | <ul><li>`throw` is a Java keyword used to manually throw an exception within a program. It is followed by an instance of the "Throwable" class or one of its subclasses, which contains information about the error or exception that has occurred. When "throw" is used, the program's execution is immediately transferred to the nearest catch block that can handle the type of exception being thrown.</li></ul>|
  | `throws` | <ul><li>`throws` keyword is used to declare that a method might throw one or more checked exceptions. This allows the method to specify which exceptions it might throw and requires the caller of the method to handle or declare the exceptions.</li></ul>|
  | `volatile` | <ul><li>volatile keyword is used to mark a variable as `volatile`. A volatile variable is a variable whose value may be modified by different threads at the same time.</li><li>When a variable is marked as volatile, it ensures that any changes made to the variable are immediately visible to other threads. This means that when a thread reads a volatile variable, it always gets the latest value of the variable, even if it was modified by another thread just before.</li><li>It's important to note that the volatile keyword does not provide atomicity, meaning it does not ensure that a sequence of operations on a volatile variable is performed atomically. If you need to perform atomic operations on a shared variable, you should use synchronization or other mechanisms such as the Atomic classes.</li></ul> |
  | `synchronized` | <ul><li>`synchronized` is a keyword that can be used to create synchronized blocks or synchronized methods to provide thread-safe access to shared resources.</li><li>When a block of code or a method is declared as synchronized, it means that only one thread can execute that block or method at a time, while other threads are blocked until the current thread releases the lock. This ensures that the shared resource is accessed in a thread-safe manner and prevents multiple threads from accessing or modifying the resource at the same time, which can cause data corruption or race conditions.</li><li>Using the synchronized keyword is a way to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner. However, it can also introduce performance overhead and may not be the most efficient solution for some scenarios. In such cases, you can consider using other synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or atomic variables, depending on your specific requirements.</li></ul> |
  | `this` | <ul><li>`this` is a keyword that refers to the current object instance of a class, which can be useful when accessing fields or methods of the object, or when calling another constructor in the same class..</li></ul> |
  | `super` | <ul><li>`super` is a keyword that refers to the superclass or parent class of a class.</li><li>When a subclass constructor is called, the first statement must be a call to a superclass constructor using the `super()` syntax. This ensures that the superclass constructor is also executed and the superclass fields are properly initialized. </li> <li>When a subclass overrides a method or redefines a field that also exists in the superclass, the super keyword can be used to explicitly refer to the superclass version of the method or field.</li> </ul>|
  | `break` | <ul><li> `break` is a keyword used to exit a loop or switch statement.</li></ul>|
  | `continue` | <ul><li> `continue` is a keyword used to skip the remaining statements in a loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.</li></ul> |
  | `switch case default` | <ul><li> `switch` is a control flow statement used to select one of multiple code blocks to execute, based on the value of an expression. Each `case` block in a `switch` statement represents a possible value of the expression, and the code block associated with that case is executed if the expression matches the value. The `default` block represents the code that is executed if none of the case blocks match the expression.</li></ul> |
  | `instanceof` | <ul><li>`instanceof` is a keyword used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or an instance of a subclass of that class. It returns a boolean value of true if the object is an instance of the specified class or subclass, and false otherwise.</li><li>The `instanceof` operator can also be used to check whether an object is an instance of a superclass or interface, or to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or its subclass.</li></ul> |
  | `transient` | <ul><li>`transient` keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when an object is written to a stream. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes so that it can be stored in a file or transmitted over a network.</li><li>Using the `transient` keyword in Java can be useful in situations where you need to exclude certain fields from being serialized, such as for security reasons or to reduce the size of the serialized output.</li></ul>|

  
## 1.2 Class Elements
  - Method:A method consists of a method signature and a method body. The method signature specifies the method's name, return type, and parameters (if any), while the method body contains the code that is executed when the method is called.
  - Constructor: A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. Its purpose is to initialize the object's state and allocate any necessary resources. The constructor has the same name as the class, and can take parameters just like any other method. However, unlike other methods, constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
  - static method: A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to any instance of the class. This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class. Static methods are commonly used for utility functions that perform a generic task that doesn't require access to any specific object's data or state. They can also be used to implement factory methods or create singleton objects. Static methods cannot access non-static fields or methods of the class, as they don't belong to any instance of the class. They can only access static fields and methods of the class.
  - default method: 
    - A default method is a method defined in an interface with a default implementation. When a class implements an interface that contains a default method, the class can choose to override the default implementation or use it as is. This provides backward compatibility for existing interfaces that need to add new methods without breaking their implementations. 
     - Before the introduction of default methods in Java 8, interfaces could only declare abstract methods that did not have an implementation. This meant that any class that implemented the interface had to provide an implementation for all the methods in the interface, even if some of the methods were not relevant to the class or if the implementation was the same across all classes.
    - Default methods were introduced to solve this problem by providing a default implementation for a method in the interface. This allows interfaces to evolve over time by adding new methods without breaking existing code that implements the interface.
  - annotation: Annotations provide a way to add metadata to Java code that can be used by the Java compiler, tools, and libraries at compile time, runtime, or deployment time.
  - package: A package is a mechanism for organizing related classes and interfaces into a single namespace.
